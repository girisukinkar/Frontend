# To improve the Frontend skills

    The goal of this repo is to learn the basic fundamentals of how the CSS works behind the screens

## Tour Agency
 Started using node-sass npm package to convert sass into css

## :not Psuedo Class Grid System

Used :not(:last-child) pseudo class and custom made grid system using float, along with mixin and width calc function

## Scalable images
 Always use percentage for width if possible to scale the images properly

## Icon font:  good for scalable icons
icon fonts can be manipulated using css as they are literally fonts: goto linea.io to download free fonts

### Video sources
To use dummy videos for the website mockup try coverr.co it provides two versions of every video mp4 and webm

## :target pseudo class to make pure css modal
using anchor tag we can manipulate the css without the need of js

## display:none transitions conflict
Display none does not allow to use animations but there is a turnaround for that which is using opacity : 0 and visibility : hidden
