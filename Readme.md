# To improve the Frontend skills

    The goal of this repo is to learn the basic fundamentals of how the CSS works behind the screens

## Tour Agency
 Started using node-sass npm package to convert sass into css

## :not Psuedo Class Grid System

Used :not(:last-child) pseudo class and custom made grid system using float, along with mixin and width calc function

## Scalable images
 Always use percentage for width if possible to scale the images properly

## Icon font:  good for scalable icons
icon fonts can be manipulated using css as they are literally fonts: goto linea.io to download free fonts
